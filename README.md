# Development Setup

This repository can be used to create a fully working development environment Ã  la MapManagement
style. I'm currently using Arch and i3 as my foundation.
[My Arch guide](https://github.com/MapManagement/dev-setup/blob/master/arch_guide.md) explains the
whole installation. To easen the process of setting up the machine after the base installation, I
created an Ansbile playbook to automate the installation and following configuration/customization
of every package I need.

## Customization

I maintain all customizations in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles) repository.
When using the Ansbile configuration, the customizations are automatically copied and applied as soon
as every application has been installed.  
Here's a recent picture of my setup:
