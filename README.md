# Development Setup
This repository can be used to create a fully working development environment Ã  la MapManagement style.
I'm currently using [Manjaro i3](https://manjaro.org/download/) as my foundation. To easen the process
of setting up a new machine, I created an Ansbile playbook to automate the installation and following
configuration/customization of every package I need.

## Software
WORK IN PROGRESS


## Customization
I maintain all customizations in my [dotfiles](https://github.com/MapManagement/dotfiles) repository.
When using the Ansbile configuration, the customizations are automatically copied and applied as soon
as every application has been installed.  
Here's a recent picture of my setup:
